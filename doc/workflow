pass_1

- parse the instruction:
  * determine format
  * if mnemonic belongs to an assembler directive:
    - process directive
    - parse next instruction
  * look up opcode from symbols table
  * if number of given operands does not much the format and op, raise error
  * populate symbol table if any symbols are encountered

pass_2

- parse instruction:
  * look up symbolic operands in symtable:
    - if a symbol is undefined, raise error
  * calculate target address
  * calculate object code
  * determine if instruction requires an M record
  * pass instruction object code to Serializer

- serialize instructions:
  * write an M record if the instruction needs relocation
  * attempt to append current instruction object code onto current T record:
    - if maxlen is exceeded, write new T record
