* an input program:
  * is a collection of SIC/XE instructions contained in a number of program blocks
  * has an optional label
  * has a start address of 0000 (can only be relocatable)
  * must contain at least START and END instructions
  * can contain comments denoted by .COMMENT

* a program block:
  # has many instructions
  # has a unique name (unless no name is defined, then the default unnamed block is used)
  # has a starting address
  # has a length

* an instruction:
  # belongs to one of 4 SIC/XE formats
  # has an operation mnemonic
  # has a number of optional operands
  # has an optional label
  # has a location
  # belongs to a program block
  # is convertable into object code

* an instruction's object code:
  # directly depends on:
    * mnemonic-translated operation code (opcode)
    * addressing mode used in instruction
    * the operands (their values or their addresses)
    * optionally, base, index, or PC registers (B,X,PC)

* an instruction's operand:
  # could be a symbol
  # could be a literal
  # could be a constant
